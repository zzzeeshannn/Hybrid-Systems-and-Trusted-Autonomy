# Hybrid-Systems-and-Trusted-Autonomy
Repository of my work with Hybrid Systems, covering topics from Reachability Analysis to Predicate Logic

### Program 1: Simulation Methods
This program holds different simulation methods like Eulers  Method, Adams-Bashford Method and RK4 Method. 

### Program 2: F16 Aircraft Simulation
Uses zero crossing methods to find intersection with the waypoint to change modes.

### Program 3: Euler Simulation for a harmonic oscillator
