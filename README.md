# Hybrid-Systems-and-Trusted-Autonomy
Repository of my work with Hybrid Systems.

### Folder 1: Simulation Methods
This folder holds different simulation methods like Eulers Method, Adams-Bashford Method and RK4 Method. 

### Folder 2: F16 Aircraft Simulation
Uses zero crossing methods (bisection) to find intersection with the waypoint to change modes.
Multiple experiments done which can be found in the folder. 

### Folder 3: Zero Crossing Methods 
Holds one sample program that was used to test three zero crossing methods - bisection, secant and newtons 
for a simple function.

### Folder 4: Set Representation 
Holds the code for different types of set representations such as Zonotopes, Startsets etc.

### Folder 5: Helpers
Contains basic codes for things I might have used here and there.

### Folder 6: SatelliteSimulation
Reachability Analysis of a satellite system (based off the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06930)
